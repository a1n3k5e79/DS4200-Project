            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Analyzing CO₂ emissions in the agri-food sector over time is essential for understanding 
                the environmental and economic consequences of food production and their long-term impact. 
                Agricultural production is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions every year, 
                with every stage of the supply chain playing a role, from crop cultivation to packaging to 
                transportation and consumption. With a growing global population, the demand for food constantly rises, 
                therefore driving production practices that often prioritize efficiency over sustainability. This trend 
                significantly contributes to climate change, threatening ecosystems, biodiversity, food security, and economic stability. 
                By analyzing emissions data across countries and years, we can gain better understanding of the relationship
                between certain practices and climate change. Identifying these relationships is a crucial first step to developing 
                sustainable food production and consumption practices in the future.

            <h2>Introduction to the data</h2>

            <p> In our analysis, we used a dataset from Kaggle titled "Agri-food CO2 emission dataset - Forecasting ML."
                The data contains information on CO₂ emissions across 236 regions, over about 30 years for each region. 
                With 6,966 entries and 34 attributes, it offers a substantial amount of data, primarily focusing on various 
                agricultural practices and their resulting CO₂ emissions, measured in kilotonnes. Below is a list of the
                attributes.

        <h2>Visualizations and Analysis</h2>

        <h3>Overall Emission and Temperature Trends</h3>

        <p>
            To fully understand the scope and trend of CO₂ emissions from agricultural practices, 
            we must first look at the broader patterns in total CO₂ emissions and the changes in global 
            temperature over time.
        </p>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="lines.html" width="100%" height="535px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>
            The chart on the left visualizes the total CO₂ emissions from 1990 to 2020, showing a steady, 
            but significant increase. While there are short periods where the level of emissions dips from year 
            to year, the overall trend follows an upward trajectory. In 2020, 18 million kilotonnes of CO₂ are 
            emitted into our atmosphere. This rise reflects the growing global population and its increasing 
            demand for efficient, large-scale food production, which often relies on unsustainable, emission-producing 
            agricultural practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chart on the right visualizes the trend in average global temperature change across different countries
            over the same time period. Again, while the temperature fluctuates, the overall trend shows a rising global 
            temperature. In 2020, we have reached an all time high, with the average rise in temperature across countries 
            being 1.5° Celsius, or 34.7° Fahrenheit.
        </p>
        <p>
            The side-by-side graphs emphasize the correlation between CO₂ emissions and the rising global temperature.
            Examining the trends closely, we can see similar peaks and troughs like the spike in both total emissions
            and average rise in temperature in the 1997-1998 range and the drop in both emissions and average rise in
            temperature in 2011. These fluctuating trends represent the tension between sustainability and efficiency in
            providing food for a growing population. With both emissions and rising temperature higher than ever, the 
            environmental and economic impacts become more imminent.  
        </p>

        <h3>Top Emission Producing Practices</h3>

        <p> 
            To better understand what agricultural practices are contributing to these overall trends, we then chose 
            to examine the top five most emission-intensive agricultural practices from 1990-2020, divided into 
            emissions from natural processes (left) vs emissions from manmade processes (right).
        </p>  
        <img src="natural_manmade.png" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></img>   
        <p> 
            These two stacked area charts help reveal two important pieces of information: which practices 
            contribute the most to emissions, and how these practices have changed over time. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            The natural emissions chart shows that rice cultivation is consistently the highest CO₂e emitting practice
            of natural emissions. This may be influenced by global dependence on rice as a food staple across cultures. 
            Additionally, the rice cultivation process (involving flooded paddy fields) contributes so much to these emissions, 
            as it provides ideal grounds for bacteria that produce a significant amount of bacteria that produce methane, an 
            equivalent greenhouse gas to CO₂. Though it is the greatest contributor of CO₂e emissions within this category, 
            its emission levels have remained fairly steady of the past 30 years. This is a trend followed by the next top 
            two most emission-producing natural practices: manure left on pastures and draining organic soils. The other top 
            emission-producing practices, fires in organic soils and savanna fires, show greater fluctuation, as they are typically 
            more sporadic or rare, likely due to climate conditions or land management.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The manmade emissions chart shows a vastly different trend. Over the past 30 years, all five major contributors 
            have shown a growth, most prominently shown by the expanding area of IPPU (Industrial Processes and Product Use). 
            Among the group, IPPU is the highest contributor to these emissions. This category is likely so large because it 
            encompasses emissions from multiple industrial activities in the agri-food sector, like refrigeration or the various 
            production of chemicals used in food packaging or processing. This growth shows the rapid industrialization of the food 
            production process, even over the past 30 years. The other most contributing factors include agri-food waste systems 
            disposal, food household consumption, food processing, and food manufacturing, further reflecting the dependence on 
            industrialization in agricultural practices. The group with the next most area growth is food household consumption, 
            reflecting the global population's growing consumerist tendencies and development of countries. Overall though, while 
            these categories exhibit growth, they maintain relatively stable emissions throughout the years. Altogether, these trends 
            show the dependence upon infrastructure and industrialization within agricultural practices and food systems.
        </p>

        <h3>Emissions Choropleth Map</h3>

        <p>
            While recognizing what agricultural practices contribute most to CO₂e emissions is important to creating more
            sustainable ones, it is also important to recognize where these emissions are being most produced.
        </p>
    
        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="agriculture_emissions.html" width="100%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>
            To analyze which countries emit the most CO₂e, we created a choropleth map that shows the level of total
            CO₂e emissions across the world over the past 30 years. The map highlights major contributors to these 
            emission, such as China, India, the United States, and Brazil, as these countries consistently appear darker 
            across time. The darker shades in many of these countries reflect the worsening of CO₂e emissions, 
            with China, India, and the United States seeing continued increases in their emissions levels as they 
            continue to industrialize and grow their agricultural practices. Other countries, particularly Indonesia,
            have more variable patterns, showing a back-and-forth between worsening emissions vs efforts toward more 
            sustainable practices or green movements. Noticeably, Brazil shows a significant reduction in emissions
            around 2012, likely due to the rollback of deforestation in the Amazon. The color changes in the map over 
            time reflect the history of CO₂e emissions and how major contributors have maintained their position
            over time.
        </p>


        <h3>Emissions by Population Factors</h3>

        <p>
            Thinking about how population affects the demand for food, we wanted to look at how population
            factors affect overall emissions.
        </p>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="per_cap_bubble_chart.html" width="100%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>
            The interactive bubble chart above reveals two major trends: regions with smaller populations tend to have greater 
            per capita emissions, and there is a general trend that the greater the population size, the greater the overall
            emissions. In areas with smaller populations, emissions per capita can be higher due to the fact that their small
            populations mean that emission-intensive practices have a disproportionally large effect on the emissions per person.
            With fewer people to offset the impact of emissions, these practices result in higher emissions per capita compared
            to highly populated areas. In more populated regions, per capita emissions are spread across a large population, even 
            though these areas contribute the most to total emissions. This trend of large populations and large overall emissions 
            reflects the growing demand for food, and therefore the greater reliance on industrialized agricultural practices.
        </p>


            <h3>Top Agricultural Emissions by Country and Category</h3>

        <p>
            While knowing which countries emit the most is valuable, it’s equally important to understand <em>how</em> those emissions happen. 
            Agricultural emissions are driven by a wide range of activities — from land-use changes like deforestation to food processing, transportation, and livestock management.
        </p>

        <p>
            To better understand the source-level patterns within high-emitting countries, we created a heatmap that shows the top 20 agricultural-emitting countries and their leading emission categories from <strong>1990 to 2020</strong>. 
            The interactive chart below allows viewers to filter by year and examine how emissions have changed over time within each country–category combination.

            Each square in the heatmap represents total emissions (in kilotonnes of CO₂ equivalent) for a specific category in a given year. The darker the square, the higher the emission level. 
            The chart focuses on the top 10 global emission sources, including <strong>Net Forest Conversion</strong>, <strong>Rice Cultivation</strong>, <strong>IPPU (industrial processes)</strong>, 
            <strong>Fertilizer Manufacturing</strong>, and <strong>Food Household Consumption</strong>. Countries like <strong>Brazil</strong> stand out for forest-related emissions, while 
            <strong>China</strong> and <strong>India</strong> show consistently high emissions from food and energy systems. This breakdown helps reveal the structural drivers of agricultural

        <h2>Summary and additional work</h2>

        <p>
            In this analysis, we aimed to explore the factors that impact and that are impacted by CO₂e emissions in the 
            agri-food sector over the past 30 years, particularly focusing on how agricultural practices affect climate change. 
            Our findings reveal that agricultural production, driven by a growing global population and their demand for food, 
            contribute greatly to greenhouse gas emissions every year. Trends in our visualizations show a strong correlation 
            between increasing CO₂ levels and the annual increase in temperature, contributed to by both natural and industrial 
            practices, though industrial practices have shown the most growth over time. Our geographic analysis highlights major 
            emitters like China, India, and the U.S. Our population analysis shows that smaller populations have higher per capita 
            emissions and larger populations have higher overall emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dataset ends in 2020 and uses machine learning to predict the later years, so the more recent data accuracy could 
            vary. That being known, it would be interesting to examine more clearly how the COVID-19 pandemic affected  emissions 
            from agricultural practices. Furthermore, exploring alternative, more sustainable agricultural practices and their 
            potential/current emissions could provide insight into how to develop sustainable practice on a large scale in 
            the future.
