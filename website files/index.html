            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Analyzing CO₂ emissions in the agri-food sector over time is essential for understanding 
                the environmental and economic consequences of food production and their long-term impact. 
                Agricultural production is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions every year, 
                with every stage of the supply chain playing a role, from crop cultivation to packaging and 
                transportation and consumption. With a growing global population, the demand for food constantly rises, 
                therefore driving production practices that often prioritize efficiency over sustainability. This trend 
                significantly contributes to climate change, threatening ecosystems, biodiversity, food security, and economic stability. 
                By analyzing emissions data across countries and years, we can gain better understanding of the relationship
                between certain practices and climate change. Identifying these relationships is a crucial first step to developing 
                sustainable food production and consumption practices in the future.

            <h2>Introduction to the data</h2>

            <p> In our analysis, we used a dataset from Kaggle titled "Agri-food CO2 emission dataset - Forecasting ML."
                The data contains information on CO₂ emissions across 236 regions, over about 30 years for each region. 
                With 6,966 entries and 34 attributes, it offers a substantial amount of data, primarily focusing on various 
                agricultural practices and their resulting CO₂ emissions, measured in kilotonnes. Below is a list of the
                attributes.

        <h2>Visualizations and Analysis</h2>
    

    
        <p>Meanwhile, we also believe that the geographical 
            information is important when evaluating the unemployment
            rate. Therefore, we also make use of geographical information 
            on <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a>. 
            The website provides the geographical information for making maps for US states. 
        </p>

        <p>To make a better data visualization, we remove the Alaska and Hawaii
            from the data. Following is an interactive map for the 
            lower 48 states in US. User can zoom in the map. The color
            indicates the unemployment rate for each state. When click any 
            state, other social factors will be revealed for the state. </p>

            <div class = 'center'>
                <iframe src="map.html" width="80%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
            
            <p>In general, west coast states tend to have higher 
                unemployment rate. On the east coast, West virginia 
                and New York state tend to have higher unemplyment rate
                than the others. In the south, Mississippi and Louisiana
                are the ones with the much higher unemplyment rate.
            </p>

        <h3>Overview of the Unemployment rate</h3>
        
        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'image'>
                <!-- <iframe src="histogram/index.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>-->
                <iframe src="histogram/finish.png" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> First, we present an overview of the unemployment rate
                    for all 50 states. Alaska is the one with the 
                    highest unemployment rate, which may due to the seasonal 
                    business in the state. The effectiveness of labor market 
                    policies and governance structures can influence unemployment 
                    rates. Washington, D.C., being the seat of government, may 
                    experience fluctuations in employment related to government 
                    spending and policies. Mississippi and Louisiana have economies 
                    that are heavily reliant on sectors such as agriculture, 
                    manufacturing, and energy. Economic downturns or fluctuations 
                    in these industries can impact employment opportunities. 
                    Connecticut, South Dakota and Virginia have the lowest 
                    unemplyment rate. These states often have diverse economies 
                    with strong sectors such as technology, healthcare, finance, 
                    and tourism. A diverse economy can provide more resilience to 
                    economic downturns.

        <h3> The relationship between unemployment rate and other social factors</h3>

        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>Moreover, we also want to examine the relationship between
                    unemployment rate and other social factors in the data. All 
                    features are numerical thus we firts create a correlation
                    plot to examine whether there are linear relationship between 
                    unemployment rate with other social factors. Notice that if 
                    the correlation is small, it only means that there is no potential
                    linear relationship between two features. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the correlation plot, among all the features, poverty 
                    has the strongest correlation with the unemployment rate since
                    they are both related to the economics. The percentage of single 
                    parents is the second important feature which inidicates the 
                    stability of family is also strongly related to the job market. 
                    The increase of unemployment rate may also related to the increase 
                    of violent crime and murder rate but has a negative relationship
                    with education indicators, like the percentage of people who go to
                    high school and college. The only variable that has no direct linear
                    relation with the unemployment rate is Metropolitan, which means the 
                    percent of residents living in a metropolitan area. 
                </p>
            </div>

            </div>   
        </div>

        <p>We have also create an interactive scatter plot so that 
            our users can select a couple of states within
            a certain range of unemployment rate and to see how the 
            other factors may be related here. 
        </p>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="scatter.html" width="85%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>Compare MA to the other states</h3>

        <p>
            Since we are in MA, thus we want to take a closer look between
            MA and other states. We create the following interactive plot
            such that user can choose another state to compare with MA and 
            show the bar plot on each factors. 
        </p>

        <div class = 'center'>

        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>
            In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the US 
            unemployment rate across states. We also examine the relation
            between unemployment rate and other social factors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, this is the 2010 data thus may be different 
            than the current economics status. Also, unemployment rate 
            may fluctuate seasonally thus adding a time series analysis
            will be more informative.
